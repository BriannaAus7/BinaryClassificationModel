# BinaryClassificationModel

A binary classification model for methadone-dependent(MD)(Patient) and Healthy Control characterisation based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data originiating from the Neural Correlates of Reward and Emotion (NCORE) in opioid dependence study.

The aim of the classifer was to investigate whether connectivity patterns derived form neuroimaging data can characterise study participants with high accuracy and discriminative power.

The input for the classifer was the affinity matrices computed from effective connectivity analysis (this was performed using Large-scale nonlinear granger causality). The effective connecitivity analysis of this work can be found in Austin _et al_(in preparation) linked here:

The steps within the code are as follows:
1. The matrices were flattened and vectorised.
2.
